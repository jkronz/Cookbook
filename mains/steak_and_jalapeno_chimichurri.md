*__Serves:__ 4* 

*__Time:__ 30 minutes*

##Ingredients

* 2 jalapeño chilis
* 2 cups cilantro leaves and sprigs, finely chopped
* 2 cups parsley leaves and sprigs, finely chopped
* 2 medium cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)
* 3 tablespoons juice from 3 to 4 limes
* 3 tablespoons dry red wine
* 1 tablespoon red-wine vinegar
* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing
* Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
* 2 pounds skirt or hangar steak

##Procedure
1. Prepare a grill or turn on a broiler (or gas burner). Grill or char the jalapeños until blackened on all sides and quite soft, about 5 minutes total. Place them in a small bowl covered with a plate or towel and allow the skins to steam and loosen. Peel, stem, and seed the chilis.
2. In a small food processor or blender, combine the jalapeños, cilantro, parsley, garlic, lime juice, red wine, olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pulse (or blend) until the mixture is a coarse puree. Taste and adjust for salt and blend again.
3. If a grill is not already prepared, heat a grill pan over high heat. Rub the steaks with olive oil and season very generously with salt and pepper. Grill until medium rare, 2 to 4 minutes per side depending on thickness (center of steaks should register 125°F on an instant read thermometer). Remove to a plate and allow to rest for at least 5 minutes.
4. Slice the steak across the grain with the knife at a 45 degree angle. Arrange on a serving plate and spoon some chimichurri over the steak. Serve with the extra sauce.
