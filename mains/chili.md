Chili
=============

This makes about a gallon of chili. 

##Ingredients
* 4 Dried Ancho (or pasilla) Chiles
* 4 Dried California Chiles
* 3 small/medium diced onions
* 4-5 pounds beef chuck steak, cut into 1" cubes
* 5-6 cloves of garlic, diced
* Beans if you want them, I use 1 can each dark & light red kidney beans. 
(Texas people bitch about this, so know your audience)
* 1t allspice
* 1t dried oregano
* 1t cumin
* 1t ground coriander
* 1T paprika
* 1 28oz can of whole tomatoes
* Some ground cayenne if necessary
* Salt/Pepper

1. Toast the dried chiles in the oven at 350 for about 5 minutes: until you can smell them. Pull them out 
and drop them in a bowl of hot water for a half hour. 

2. Brown the steak in batches on medium-high in a large pot and set it aside. Try to not let the fond at 
the bottom of the pot burn. I probably go 3-4 minutes, stir to flip them, and 3-4 minutes more per batch.

3. While the beef is cooking, take the peppers out of the water and remove the stems and seeds. The 
seeds make the chili more spicy, so I save them to add spice later. Put the peppers in a food pro or 
blender and add a bit of water to cover them, then blend the peppers into a paste. 

4. By now the batches of steak should be about done. Cook the onions in the fat & drippings that have 
built up in the bottom of your pot. Scrape up the bottom to get all that awesome stuff unstuck. When 
the onions just start to change a little brown, add the garlic and the dried spices. Cook another minute. 

5. Add the tomatoes with the liquid and bring everything to a boil. 

6. Rinse the beans and add them and the beef to the pot and add enough water to cover everything. In my 
pot, everything reaches about the 5qt line. Simmer for at least an hour, but 2 or 3 is cool too. Just 
make sure the meat is tender. After an hour, there's usually some fat that floats to the top, skim that
off. Then start to taste and adjust the seasoning. If it needs more spice, add the pepper seeds or some 
ground cayenne. Add a bunch of salt and pepper too.
